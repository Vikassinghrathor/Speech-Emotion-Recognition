# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-ML-and-DL
Emotions are important part of understanding human interactions. Research is going into finding methods that can at the very least mimic human ability to recognise emotions displayed in the form of facial expressions, changes in tone while speaking, etc. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is one of such fields. Using deep learning and machine learning algorithms with the help of Ravdess and TESS dataset we aim to design an automatic emotion recognition system.
